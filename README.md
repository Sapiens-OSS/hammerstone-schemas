# Hammerstone DDAPI Schemas
If you're the average mod-user you're probably lost. Check out the [Hammerstone Framework](https://github.com/Sapiens-OSS/hammerstone-framework) (it's probably what you're looking for).

These schemas represent the available options and configuration for the DDAPI. Currently, this project is only used by the Hammerstone Web Builder.

## Get your own schemas discovered by the Sapiens Web Builder
Add the `hammerstone-schemas` tag to your GitHub project and the Sapiens Web Builder will automatically discover and suggest it when adding new schemas.
